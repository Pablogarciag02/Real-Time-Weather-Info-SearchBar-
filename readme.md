This activity was interesting and hard at the same time.

Since all my focus was being directed towards the project i did not have much brainpower left to fulfill this task.
However, since we used tailwind in our final project, i decided to use it here to practice and hone my tailwind skills.

The activity contains two files:
-Index.html
-Script.js

INDEX.HTML:
this of course was used to complete the skeleton of the page. However if you observe you can see how i was using tailwinds class system to populate the css inside of the html itself. I thouroughly enjoyed using tailwind to to the fact that instead of having predetermined styles like bootstrap. you actually need to know css lingo to operate using tailwind.

The html consists of the header which contains the weather dashboard.
the search bar and search button are ontop of a div that which bellow contains the button for history of the searches.

Then to the side we have 2 main divs, one shows us the current weather for the city.

Below that we can observe 5 mini divs that contain the placement of the forecast.


SCRIPT.JS
In my script js file we can see that i get info from the api two times. This is due to the fact that one brings me the current weather and the other brings me a forecast for the next 5 days every 3 hours. For this reason, i was able to get the current weather for the searched city and the forecast of the same variable for the next five days.

As you can see, i had problems displaying the image of the current weather within the div. I dont know the reason behind this. Due to the fact that within the img source i was citing the link which contained the image i wanted itself.

This activity was fun to do, although hard do to my lack of time thanks to my focus going into the project.
